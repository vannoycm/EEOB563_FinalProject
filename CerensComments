First paragraph of the background you don't have to say population groups. It sounds a little redundant.
In the same centence im not sure what you are trying to say. Maybe "In certain populations, the likelihood an individual will inherit and mutate the BRCA1 or the BRCA2 gene can vary."?
Also, I will try to not repeat the corrections Bruno made from now on so it's not too repetitive. 
For the figures, just make a legend under the figures and explain what the figure is. That way, when you are explaining something related to it, you an refer back to it. 
If you guys want, I can show you how to make a figure legends.
Like Audrey said, your research question on the paper should be in your introduction. You don't need another title for it.
On page 6, again, a legend under your table would be good.
In your methods, I don't think you should use screenshots. I personally think it makes it look informal. So like Audrey said, just type out what your parameters are.
Write down the steps you did for NJ analysis as well as your Bayesian analysis.
If you want to have the distance matrix that you generated using PAUP, I would just make a figure legend under it and then state the results.
On page 8 and 9, please put figure legends for your NJ tree, and the other alignment trees.
On page 9, under MrBayes, mayge write your likelihoods in full sentences?
On page 10, you don't hhave to write your code, just write your parameters in full sentences. 
I don't understand what the figure on page 10 is. This is why you must inlclude legends so the readers can know what they are interpreting.
Again on page 11, put legends please under your figures.
The title for discussion can just be discussion.
In your discussion just explain how and if your results supported or didn't support your hypothesis. You can also add why/how these results are helpful in general. Future directions that can be taken? Any other methods that can be used? Broader impact?
You guys are doing great! :)
